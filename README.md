IVEngine
========

If you are or were a JAVA programmer, you should hear of "Spring" library, which is a very popular framework for managing components. It can make the whole enterprise application more scalable and of better hierarchy by making full use of XML language. To quote the official description of Spring : "Spring helps development teams everywhere build simple, portable,  fast and flexible JVM-based systems and applications".

As once an IOS developer, out of inspiration from Spring,  I decided to make a Spring-like framework in Objective-C for fun. Honestly, I don't think this kit can make any difference in practical IOS development since it seems inefficient and    unnecessary to embed it to a view-based application. However if someday Objective-C will be an option for server side development, which I think impossible as there are already so many options for server side development like php, python and JAVA, I think IVEngine would offer a favor.

Anyway, all I provide by IVEngine is primarily a kind of a principle for software development which is suitable for all kinds of platforms. So if you think the whole idea is useless or even idiotic, you could just skip the following part of this page.
